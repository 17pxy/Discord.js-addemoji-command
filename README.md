# Discord.js-addemoji-command
Add emojis to your server using a simple command.

How to use:
`!addemoji <emoji>`

⚠️ | Attention:

You `cannot` add emojis that are `already` in discord by `default`.

This command `works` in version `13` of discord.js.

If you need help you can write to me by discord: `rtx#3317`
